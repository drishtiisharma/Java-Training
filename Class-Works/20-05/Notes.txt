constructors: are used to intialize the objects. there are two types of constructors:
1. default/automatic constructor:
it is the factory of objects, provided by java for each such class that doesnt contain, any user defined constructor.
**provided automatically by java's API(library)
**no garbage value in java, by default its always 0.
**no parameters in default constructor
Q. can we create default constructors manually?

2. user defined/paramertized constructor
it is,just like a method/ special type of method of class but constructor and method has some differences...
1) constructor name must always be the same as the class name, methods cannot have the same name as the class name
2) constructors cannot return any value, methods have to even if no return type, ie void.
3)constructors are called automatically when we create any object of class, while methods have to be called manually.

$ what happens when object is created,what initializes the object- constructor is called(type depends on the parameters passed)




##no 2 constructors can have the same parameters, ie same name but not same parameters!
#constructors are always known by their arguments
#instance variable(jiski copy object me jayegi) and local variable(created inside a block,copy not created inside object)
inside a block, local variable gets the preference over global/instance variable
#when local and instance variable name is same- "this" is used.
#no two same methods with same prototype in the same class


method overloading: when we create more than 1 method with similar name and return type different in parameter list, class allows these methods and this technique is known as method overloading.


static members of java:
there are 3 static members of java:
1)static data member: it doesnt instantiate for object of class. it has only a single copy in memory, shared by objects of class.
**try with normal(id-count problem)
2)static member method: it can use only static members of class in its body.
it can also be called by using class name, without object.
3)static block: it is a self-executable block of code, it will execute automatically when program control come inside the class, first time, where it was declared.

##only self executable things in java- static block and main method, but only once

##instance block creates the object->allocates memory

sequence of program execution:
static block
instance block
constructor
method


inheritance: basically 5 types of inheritance:
1)single inheritance
super class/ base class
|
v
sub class/ derived

2) multi level
class1
|
v
class2
|
v
class3
 
3) multiple
class1     class2
         \     /
        class3
**note: java doesnt allow multiple inheritance by using classes

4) hierarchical
	class1
	/       \
            class2    class3

5)hybrid
combination of more than 1 type like hierarchical+multilevel+single


HW:
*multilevel*multiple

##TO BE NOTED IN COPY:
name and balance
not to be taken as input:
accno to be generated automatically like 1,2,3... as we make objects


method overriding: when we create more than 1 method with similar prototype in a class,then class will not allow these methods, but if a sub class contains more than 1 method with similar protoype in which 1 method comes from super class by inheritance and other is developed by subclass itself. then sub class allows these methods and this technique is known as, method overriding.
**correct methodoverriding problem
super keyword:
super is a keyword which represents the name of the super class inside sub class
